--there is a filter called "UsernamePasswordAuthernticationFilter" which will extract the username and password from the user request and build the "Authentication" object.

--here Authentication is an interface and its implementation class name is "UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken".

--after creating the object of Authentication, this filter will call a method of AuthenticationManager(I)
called:

Authentication authenticate(Authentication auth);

--here AuthenticationManager is an interface and the implementation class name is "ProviderManager"

--this authenticate(-) method will check with variaous supported AuthenticationProviders and then this authenticate(-) method will call another

Authentication authenticate(Authentication auth);
method on the implementation of appropriate AuthenticationProvider.

--the default implementation of AuthenticationProvider is DAOAuthenticationProvider.

Note: we can define our own AuthenticationProvider implementation also.


--this Default DAOAuthenticationProvider will take the help of UserDetailsService.

--inside the UserDetailsService interface, there is only one abstract method called:

UserDetails loadUserByUsername(String username);

--we can implement this interface and return the UserDetails object based on our requirement.

--By default Spring Security f/w has provided an implementation class of this UserDetailService interface 
which is "InMemoryUserDetailsService"

Spring Security has provided the implementation of UserDetails interface also, the name of this implementation class is "User"

--developer can implement this UserDetails interface and customize this User details object also.


--Once AuthenticationManager will get the Authentication object after sucessfull authentication then AM will populate the Principle object inside this Authentication object and keep this Authentication object inside the SecurityContext object.

Principle object will represent the Authenticated User.



BasicAuthenticationFilter:
--------------------------------

this filter is responsible for processing any request that has a HTTP request header of Authorization with an authentication scheme of Basic and a Base64-encoded username:password token. For example, to authenticate user "bob" with password "1234" the following header would be presented:
